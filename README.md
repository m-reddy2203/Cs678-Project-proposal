Import all the necessary libraries with the versions
Modify the transformer library which has modleing_bert.py by adding 3 classes(SememeEmbeddings, BertSememeEmbeddings, BertSememeModel)from bert_english
_sememe.py or bert_chinese_sememe..py and add the BertSememeModel class in the __init__.py .
All the classes should be added at end of the code so that it doesnot face any dependency issues.
Run the code according to the main.py
If we run the main.py it implements both the models and gives the metric values and checks the robustness of the model.
d.xlsx is a multilingual dataset which is used to implement multiliguality.
Add the lines where we add the dataset by importing pandas
dataset is an another dataset which is used for robustness
